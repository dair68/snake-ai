# Snake AI

A game of snake made with Python's Tkinter module. Like all snake games, here the player uses arrow keys to control a moving line that collects pellets. 
What sets this thing apart is a mode where the AI controls the snake!

The AI is programmed with a strategy that encompasses snake safety, quick pellet paths, and smooth endgame. It took many, many tries to get it right.
But after a whole lot of graph theory, I finally created an AI that can reliably win a 10 by 10 snake grid in around 3 minutes. 
Because the app has a 10 by 10 grid, the AI is designed for games with even x even dimensions. However, the idea behind the "AdvancedAI" class could be adapted for
games with even x odd or odd x odd dimensions, believe it or not.

This app was developed in Windows 11.
